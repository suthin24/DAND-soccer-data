This is a soccer database provided by kaggle by collecting several data of performances from all teams in European Leagues, Individual player data performances and Team data performances. From this database, I have decided to collect information such as: 1) Player with most improved performance in all of Europe, 2) Top rated teams based on Team Attributes and 3) Player with most penalty convertion rates.
